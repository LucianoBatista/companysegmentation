# Challenge Summary

__Your organization wants to know which companies are similar to each other to help in identifying potential customers of a SAAS software solution (e.g. Salesforce CRM or equivalent) in various segments of the market. The Sales Department is very interested in this analysis, which will help them more easily penetrate various market segments.__

You will be using stock prices in this analysis. You come up with a method to classify companies based on how their stocks trade using their daily stock returns (percentage movement from one day to the next). This analysis will help your organization determine which companies are related to each other (competitors and have similar attributes). 

# Objectives

- Modeling: `kmeans()` and `umap()`
- Iteration: `purrr`
- Data Manipulation: `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `tibble`
